# Polaroid

The Polaroid Virtual Machine, written in Go

## Virtual Machine registers

| Registers | Description | Stored in AR |
|----------:|:---|:---:|
| `pc`      |  Program Counter | no |
| `esp`     |  Stack Pointer | no |
| `tp`      |  This pointer | no |
| `tr`      | Temporary Register | no |
| `eax` `ebx` `ecx` `edx` | General purpose registers | no |
| `lpc` | Last Program Counter | yes |
| `ltp` |  Last This Pointer | yes |
| `r0 ... r31` | Local variable registers | yes |

This means that the machine itself provides the `pc`, `esp`, `tp` and `me` registers
but `eax`, `ebx`, `ecx`, `edx`, `ltp` are referenced in each Activation Record.
That is, each time an AR is generated, `pc` is transfered in the new `tpc` and same
goes for `tp` being copied in `ltp`. `r1` and all successive registers are allocated to
the parameters passed to the function. `r0` holds the number of arguments that were passed.
The `tr` register is used by the `swap` and branch tests instructions as a **T**emporary **R**egister.

## Assembler instructions

Each assembler instruction has from 0 to 3 operands that can either be registers, constants
or memory references (pointers). Each operand is label using this convention :

* `A` is the first operand
* `B` is the second operand
* `C` is the third operand

For a whole instruction must hold in 32 bits, each operand must be 8 bits long. An operand binary representation is as follows :

```
bits   0      2                  8
       | type |       value      |
```

Where type is :

* `00` if the operand refers to a register
* `01` if the operand refers to a constant (up to 2^6 - 1) in the pool
* `10` if the operand refers to a the memory address stored in the given register

Let's analyze the `add eax, 21, [r2]` instruction that is just `eax = k[21] + *r2;`, where `k` is the constant pool.
Assuming the `add` opcode is right, it is compiled down to:

```
   OPCODE  A          B         C 

      add  eax        21        [r2]
0010 1100  0000 0100  0101 0101 1000 1101
           ^^         ^^        ^^
            |          |         |
            |          |        10 : refers to what is stored at the address stored in r2
            |         01 : refers to a constant (the 21st)
           00 : refers to a register
```

## Assembler specifications

* `R` is the symbol for _any register_
* `K` is the symbol for _constant index_
* `A` is the symbol for _address_


* `[.]` means that there might be no prefix
* `c` stands for `Char`
* `i` stands for `Int`
* `f` stands for `Float`
